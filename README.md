# SaveMyFavs
This is a rails-react application with CRUD functions and user authentication

## Note:
This was originally a monolith project but due to deployment complications, I removed the client and set deployed it independently. Its repository is here: 
https://github.com/KevinKipkoechMutai/save-my-fav-frontend 

New backend repo: 
https://github.com/KevinKipkoechMutai/save-my-fav-backend

Backend deploy link:
https://my-backend-production-cc33.up.railway.app/my_favorites


CRUD functions: DELETE, READ, CREATE, UPDATE. PS: The last two are not yet 100% done (95% for DELETE and 50% for UPDATE) due to time consumed trying to deploy.

ISSUE: User authentication failed on deployment. Working to resolve this ASAP.
